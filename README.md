# We Split
Followed along with Project 1 (found here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui) to create a small app that takes in user's bill amount and party size data to split the bill 
across multiple people. Gained experience using @State, @FocusState, TextField, Picker, and creating views in a loop using ForEach.
